echo "----------------------------------------------"
echo "   ✅ BUILD TIME: Variables are NOT available during 'docker build'"
echo "   ✅ RUN TIME: Variables from .env.docker ARE available when container starts"
echo "   ✅ COMPOSE: env_file: .env.docker correctly loads variables"
echo "   ✅ RUNTIME: Your application reads process.env.VARIABLE_NAME at startup"

echo "🔧 Your Docker Configuration is Correct:"
echo "   • docker-compose.yml has env_file: .env.docker"
echo "   • docker-entrypoint.sh reads process.env variables"
echo "   • Settings initialization preserves user customizations"
