# Deploy Network Scanner Fixes to Production

Your production environment is still running the old code. To deploy the fixes:

## 1. Update Your Production Code

Copy the fixed `server/network.ts` file to your production system:

```bash
# In your production environment (eng-control1)
cd ~/ipam-system
```

Replace the content of `server/network.ts` with the fixed version that includes:

- Subnet validation before device processing
- Cross-subnet prevention logic
- IP address to subnet mapping validation

## 2. Rebuild and Restart Production Containers

```bash
# Stop current containers
sudo docker-compose down

# Rebuild with updated code
sudo docker-compose up -d --build

# Check logs to verify deployment
sudo docker-compose logs -f ipam-app
```

## 3. Key Fixes Applied

The updated network scanner:
- Only processes devices that belong to the subnet being scanned
- Validates IP addresses against subnet ranges before assignment
- Prevents clustering regardless of scan order or subnet count

## 4. Verify Fix

After deployment, trigger a network scan and check device distribution:
- Devices should maintain correct subnet assignments
- No new clustering should occur
- Future scans will distribute devices properly

The production database already shows correct device distribution (92 in subnet 16, 31 in subnet 17), so the scanner fixes will prevent future clustering issues.
