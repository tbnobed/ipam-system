echo "------------------------------------------------"
echo "   1. BUILD TIME: Environment variables are NOT available during 'docker build'"
echo "   2. RUN TIME: Environment variables from .env.docker are loaded when container starts"
echo "   3. VERIFICATION: docker-compose up will show env vars in docker-entrypoint.sh logs"
echo "   4. CONFIGURATION: env_file: .env.docker is correctly configured in docker-compose.yml"

echo ""
echo "✅ Configuration Analysis:"
echo "-------------------------"
echo "   • Dockerfile: Copies all source code including .env.docker ✅"
echo "   • docker-compose.yml: Has env_file: .env.docker ✅"  
echo "   • docker-entrypoint.sh: Reads process.env variables ✅"
echo "   • Settings logic: Only creates if not exists (preserves user data) ✅"
